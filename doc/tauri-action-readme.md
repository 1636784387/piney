# Tauri GitHub Action

This GitHub Action builds your Tauri application as a native binary for macOS, Linux and Windows and optionally upload it to a GitHub Release.

## Example

**_For more workflow examples, check out the [examples](examples) directory._**

This GitHub Action has three main usages: test the build pipeline of your Tauri app, uploading Tauri artifacts to an existing release, and creating a new release with the Tauri artifacts.

This example shows the most common use case for `tauri-action`. The action will build the app, create a GitHub release itself, and upload the app bundles to the newly created release.

This is generally the simplest way to release your Tauri app.

```yml
name: 'publish'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

# This workflow will trigger on each push to the `release` branch to create or update a GitHub release, build your app, and upload the artifacts to the release.

    # - `[ext]`: file extension (`.app`, `.dmg`, `.msi`, `.exe`, `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.apk`, `.aab`, `.ipa`)
    # - `[mode]`: `debug` or `release` depending on the use of the `--debug` flag.

    # - `[_setup]`: `_setup` for the NSIS installer or an empty string for all other types.

    #
    # default: If not set, the names given by Tauri's CLI are kept.
    releaseAssetNamePattern: ''

    # Whether to upload the unbundled executable binary or not. Requires Tauri v2+.
    # To prevent issues with Tauri's `bundle_type` value (used by e.g. the updater) this
    # should only be used with the `--no-bundle` flag.
    # ONLY ENABLE THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING since Tauri does NOT officially support a portable mode,
    # especially on platforms other than Windows where

    # EXPERIMENTAL - Whether to build for mobile or desktop.
    #
    # Effectively changes the build command from `${tauriScript} build`
    # to `${tauriScript} android build` / ` ${tauriScript}ios build`
    #
    # Note that you have to install system dependencies (Xcode, SDKs, etc) yourself.
    # Furthermore, the action does not upload the app to the App Store or Play Store.
    # The .apk and .ipa files can be uploaded to the release or as workflow artifcats, but
    # plain .ipa files are generally useless so uploading them to a release is not recommended.
    #
    # - Can be set to "android" to build for Android. This works on all runners but other
    # required actions typically only work on Ubuntu so we recommend Ubuntu as well.
    # - Can be set to "ios` to build for iOS. This only works on macOS runners.
    # - Any other value will be ignored.
    #
    # default: unset

## Tips and Caveats

- You can run custom Tauri CLI scripts with the `tauriScript` option. So instead of running `yarn tauri <COMMAND> <ARGS>` or `npm run tauri <COMMAND> <ARGS>`, we'll execute `${tauriScript} <COMMAND> <ARGS>`.
  - Useful when you need custom build functionality when creating Tauri apps e.g. a `desktop:build` script or if you use `cargo install tauri-cli`.
  - `tauriScript` can also be an absolute file path pointing to a `tauri-cli` binary. The path currently cannot contain spaces.

- If you want to add additional arguments to the build command, you can use the `args` option. For example, if you're setting a specific target for your build, you can specify `args: --target your-target-arch`.

- When your Tauri app is not in the root of the repo, use the `projectPath` input.
  - Usually it will work without it, but the action will install and use a global `@tauri-apps/cli` installation instead of your project's CLI which can cause issues if you also configured `tauriScript` or if you have multiple `tauri.conf.json` files in your repo.
  - Additionally, relative paths provided via the `--config` flag will be resolved relative to the `projectPath` to match Tauri's behavior.
  - The path must NOT be gitignored. Please open an issue if this causes you problems.

- If `releaseId` is set, the action will use this release to upload assets to. If `tagName` is set the action will try to find an existing release for that tag. If there's none, the action requires `releaseName` to create a new release for the specified `tagName`.

- If you create the release yourself and provide a `releaseId` but do not set `tagName`, the download url for updater bundles in `latest.json` will point to `releases/latest/download/<bundle>` which can cause issues if your repo contains releases that do not include updater bundles.

- If you provide a `tagName` to an existing release, `releaseDraft` must be set to `true` if the existing release is a draft.

- If you only want to build the app without having the action upload any assets, for example if you want to only use [`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact), simply omit `tagName`, `releaseName` and `releaseId`.

- Only enable `uploadPlainBinary` if you are sure what you're doing since Tauri doesn't officially support a portable mode, especially on platforms other than Windows where standalone binaries for GUI applications basically do not exist.

- Gitea support is experimental. It was implemented and tested solely by the community.

- `uploadWorkflowArtifacts` will likely be removed once [actions/upload-artifact#331](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/331) lands.

- `[setup]` can be used to differenciate between the NSIS installer and the binary from `uploadPlainBinary` (both have the `.exe` extension).

- `[bundle]` is likely only useful for `workflowArtifactNamePattern` and _not_ for `releaseAssetNamePattern` because of its conflict with `[ext]`.

- The action's iOS and Android support is considered experimental, please report any issues or feedback you may have in this repository.
